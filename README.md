## .env files

In order to successfully connect to the databases and run it locally you will have to create a .env files and set the correct database name  for the correct environment. You can do this by adding 'PGDATABASE=db-name' where db-name is going to  be the correct DB name. You can find information of DB names in /db/setup.sql file. Also make sure you .gitignore this files so you dont share your environment variables.
